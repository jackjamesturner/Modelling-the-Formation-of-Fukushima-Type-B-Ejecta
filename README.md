# Modelling-the-Formation-of-Fukushima-Type-B-Ejecta
Repository for generated data used in the study titled "Modelling the Formation of `Type B' Ejecta - the Unique Thermometers of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster", published in Nature Scientific Reports.
.txt files for each of the three particles (CF-01-R009, CF-01-T18, CF-01-T06) contain data generated by our numerical model.  This data inlcudes the following arrays:
Final bubble diameters (μm) - bubble diameters once the entire particle has cooled past the glass transition temperature.
Bubble initial positions (μm) (not normalised) - nucleation points of bubbles expressed as a radial distance in μm from the particle centre.
Bubble initial positions (normalised) - nucleation points of bubbles expressed as a ratio over the total particle radius (eg 0.50 is half way between the particle centre and the article surface).
